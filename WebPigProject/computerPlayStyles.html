		<h3>Computer Dice Strategies</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/pigDiceLot.jpg" id="bodyImage"> <br>
		At this website you will find three main play styles for the Computer.
		Each Style has its strengths and weaknesses <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Cautious - This play style is extremely straight forward. The Computer
		believes that any points gained are better than lost so at the end of
		every successful toss the cautious player holds. They are very
		consistent but rarely threatening as the most points they can gain in
		one round is only twelve <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Random - This play style decides on holding or throwing based on pure
		chance. The player has a fifty-fifty chance of tossing or holding
		every round up to three tosses. He is not willing to chance it after
		three attempts. The random chance is a surprisingly strong competitor
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Greedy - This is the final play style. The Greedy player attempts
		three throws regardless of outcome or possible points lost. This style
		is the exact opposite of the Cautious player and has huge gains but
		will forfeit many points in its search for more. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The final play style is not so much a real strategy or style but a
		cheater plain and simple. The Cheater never bothers with dice but
		knows if he averages 25 he will easily beat any competior. Thus he
		always rolls 25. Try your luck at facing him
		<br>
		<br>
		Try facing all the play styles - the best strategy is
		often an adaptive one, for the best chance of success switch your
		strategy depending upon the player your facing <br>
