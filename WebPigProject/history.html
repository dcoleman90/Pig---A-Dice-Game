		<h3>History of Pigs - the Dice game</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		First written by John Scarne in 1945 Pigs is a simple folk dice game
		which has had many different renditions and slight rule changes. The
		basic core of the game is featured throughout many different
		renditions and names. The goal of the game is to roll a score of 100.
		The most common variant (the one played here) is accomplished by
		rolling a six sided die. After each roll a player adds the total to
		their temporary points. Then they can decided to roll again and
		attempt to gain more points or pass their turn and convert all the
		current turns temporary points to permanent points. <br>
		The catch is if at any point the player rolls a one then they forfeit
		all their temporary points and pass there turn to the other player. <br>
		<br>
		The games simplicity combined with a great deal of luck and strategy
		allowed remain popular especially in rural areas for quite some time.
		Other variants of the game rolling two dice, with different outcomes
		for doubles and other variances also became popular. <br>
		<br>
		The inherent math probability concepts lead it to be a common tool for
		math teachers, elementary students could play it to practice addition.
		Later it became a strong tool in the use of teaching artificial
		intelligence. This causes the computer to balances gaining optional
		scoring with their opponents progress in the game. <br>
		<br>
		Weather it a game for learning or just for fun the simplicity of pigs
		is fun for everyone
