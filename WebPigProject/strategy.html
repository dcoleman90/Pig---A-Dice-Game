		<h3>Strategy behind Pigs</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Pigs is a surprisingly deeply strategic game. There are many thoughts
		on the best approach. Arguments have been made to roll the dice only a
		predetermined amount of times while others argue to roll until a value
		is reached. Studies have shown that looking at the number of rolls is
		subject to a gambler’s fallacy, - is the mistaken belief that, if
		something happens more frequently than normal during a given period,
		it will happen less frequently in the future. The far more efficient
		method is to save your rolls after a predetermined value is reached. <br>
		<br>
		At what point is the risk of gaining more points worth the risk of the
		points already captured. Simple math tells us that that the odds of
		rolling a one on a six sided die or one in five. The average value of
		a successful roll (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is four. Thus it worth bring the
		total of the temporary points up to 20 before banking. After the 20
		the possibility of losing all the acquired value is begins to greatly
		diminish the possible return. In other words it is not worth risking
		27 points to possibly acquire 3. This is known as the “hold at 20”
		rule. <br>
		<br>
		Even within in these parameters there are still many times when it is
		worth violating the “hold at 20” rule. As this is a competitive game
		it could be worth risking far more points dependent upon your
		opponents score. For instance if your score is 70 and your opponent is
		at 98 he has a one in five chance at automatically winning next turn.
		The best strategy – even though it is a long shot – is to keep rolling
		until victory or an unfortunate one ends the turn. As loss counts the
		same regardless of point differential thus there is no advantage to
		losing with a high score. <br>
		<br>
		Todd W Neller and Clifton GM Presser from Gettysburg College wrote a
		very detailed paper looking at the possible outcomes and when it was
		best to bet it all or rely on the “hold at 20” rule. <a
