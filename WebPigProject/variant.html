		<h3>The many different versions of Pig</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/pigDiceLot.jpg" id="bodyImage">
		Due to a number of factors, most centering upon the simplicity and
		rural nature of the game Pigs, many different spin-off versions of the
		game have been created. <br>
		<br>
		Most of these versions involve adding a second dice and differing the
		rules based upon the second dice outcome. In the Two-Dice variant,
		players add both dice sums to their total. If either dice results in a
		one their turn is forfeit, if both dice are ones then they lose all
		their points (even the stored ones) and have to end their turn at a
		value of 0. Some versions compel players who roll doubles to roll
		again, rather than bank their points. One popular version known as Big
		Pig is more forgiving and on upon rolling doubles gives the player
		twice the value rolled, and on double ones grants them a score of
		twenty-five<br>
		<br>
		Skunk is a group version of two dice pig where players play a
		predetermined five rounds. All player bet on one set of dice and may
		choose to hold at any time. The pair of dice are continuously rolled
		until a one appears, or everyone holds. At this point everyone who has
		not held forfeits all points from the round. The winner is the player
		with the highest number of points at the end of five rounds<br>
		<br>
		Other versions involve reactions between certain predetermined
		outcomes. Most of these are house rules and take effect when certain
		unlikely outcomes arise, such as rolling doubles multiple times in a
		row. <br>
